# Access to Drinking Water – Data Analysis Project using Google Sheets

This project is part of an integrated data analytics learning experience focused on exploring **global access to safe and affordable drinking water**. The analysis supports **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)** by examining inequalities in service levels across different countries and regions.

## Project Overview

The project uses data from the **WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)** for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. The dataset covers household access to drinking water services from 2000 to 2020.

We conducted in-depth exploratory analysis using **Google Sheets**, transforming and visualizing the data to uncover patterns and trends. The goal was to draw insights and answer key questions about water accessibility around the world.

## Key Topics Explored

### Part 1: General Access and Disparities
- Comparison of dataset population to global population estimates
- Urban vs. rural population distribution and water access
- Spread and trends across different service levels (e.g., safely managed, basic, surface water)
- National, urban, and rural water access breakdown
- Relationship between water access, national population, and GNI (Gross National Income)

### Part 2: Trends Over Time
- Differences between 2020 snapshot data and full dataset
- Annual Rates of Change (ARC) in access levels by country and region
- Temporal trends in basic water access across urban and rural populations
- Influence of population size on ARC

## Dataset Summary

| Column         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Country/Area   | Geographic location |
| Year           | Year of estimate |
| Population     | Population (in thousands) |
| % Urban        | Urban population percentage |
| Service Levels | % of population by water access type (national, rural, urban) |

**Service Levels:**
- **Safely Managed:** Improved source, accessible on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination
- **Basic:** Improved source with collection time ≤30 minutes
- **Limited:** Improved source with collection time >30 minutes
- **Unimproved:** Unprotected dug wells or springs
- **Surface Water:** Directly from rivers, lakes, streams, etc.
